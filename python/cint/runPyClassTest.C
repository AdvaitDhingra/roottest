// This test is no longer one script as it once was: Cling compiles code
// within a single macro, so there is a problem of initialization of the
// python interpreter, and of call order: the python classes need to be
// fully loaded into C++ before they can be used in declarations. This is
// different from the line-to-line behaviour of CINT (and the ROOT CLI).

// load a python class and test its use

// load another python class and test it (note that this test was setup for
// a CINT-specific problem of not being able to build closures; that is in
// principle a non-issue with Cling)
   TPython::LoadMacro( "MyOtherPyClass.py" );
